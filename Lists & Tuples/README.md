# Concepts Covered
- List creation and manipulation
- Accessing and modifying list items
- Iterating through lists
- Tuple basics and differences from lists
- Conversion between lists and tuples

# Section 1: List Basics
Problem 1:
Create a list of 5 numbers and print the list.

Problem 2:
Access the first and last element from the list and print them.

Problem 3:
Add a new element to the list using append() and print the updated list.

Problem 4:
Insert an element at a specific position using insert() and display the list.

Problem 5:
Remove an element from the list using remove() and pop() methods.

Problem 6:
Ask user to input N numbers and form a list dynamically, then print it.

# Section 2: List Operations
Problem 7:
Find the maximum and minimum values from a list.

Problem 8:
Sort the list in ascending and descending order.

Problem 9:
Reverse the list and display it.

Problem 10:
Count how many times a particular element appears in the list.

Problem 11:
Demonstrate list slicing by printing sub-parts of the list (first 3 elements, last 2 elements, etc.)

Problem 12:
Accept a sentence from the user and convert it into a list of words using split().

# Section 3: Tuple Basics
Problem 13:
Create a tuple containing 5 items and print it.

Problem 14:
Access 2nd and 4th element of the tuple.

Problem 15:
Try to modify an element and observe what happens (immutability demo).

Problem 16:
Convert the tuple into a list, add an element, and convert it back to a tuple.

Problem 17:
Perform slicing on the tuple (e.g., first 3 elements, last 2 elements).

Problem 18:
Ask user for 3 numbers and store them as a tuple. Then unpack the tuple into 3 separate variables and print them individually.

# Section 4: Logical Challenges (Lists + Tuples Combined)
Problem 19:
Find the largest and smallest number in a list without using max() or min() (use loops).

Problem 20:
Remove duplicate elements from a list.

Problem 21:
Given two lists, find the common elements.

Problem 22:
Count the frequency of each element in a list and display the result (hint: dictionary or nested loop).

Problem 23:
Convert a list of tuples into a dictionary.
Example: [("name", "Prashant"), ("age", 25)] → {"name": "Prashant", "age": 25}

Problem 24: loops, lists, sets, and indexing — perfect practice for real-world coding logic!
Accept a list of integers from the user. Remove all duplicates.
Sort the unique numbers in ascending order. Print the 2nd largest unique number.
